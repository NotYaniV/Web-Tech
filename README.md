This Repo contains my journey of learning Webtechnology and different aspects of it.
It is always fun to learn and explore new techs which you are lacking behind in or have'nt developed a good relation with.

Most of the code was typed in VS code and was run on chrome (Latest Version at point of testing).
Additional packages for beautifying code were used alongside, some of them are Live Server extension of VS Code.

Feel free to clone the repo and make changes, design and run it the way you like it.

KEEP CODING !
